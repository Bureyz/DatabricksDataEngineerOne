    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **1. Lakeflow Streaming vs Batch**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lakeflow: CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE + FLOW\n",
    "Notebook: spark.read → transform → write (batch)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods create an identical data model!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **2. Calculations in Silver (not Bronze)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Silver orders - calculated measures\n",
    "gross_amount = quantity * unit_price\n",
    "discount_amount = gross_amount * discount_percent / 100\n",
    "net_amount = gross_amount - discount_amount\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **3. SCD Type 2 - Lakeflow format**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Lakeflow: AUTO CDC ... STORED AS SCD TYPE 2\n",
    "# Notebook: Manual MERGE with __START_AT, __END_AT\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query current: WHERE __END_AT IS NULL\n",
    "# Query historical: WHERE date BETWEEN __START_AT AND __END_AT\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **4. Star Schema Query Pattern**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT f.*, d.year, c.customer_segment, p.product_name\n",
    "FROM fact_sales f\n",
    "JOIN dim_date d ON f.order_date_key = d.date_key\n",
    "JOIN dim_customer c ON f.customer_id = c.customer_id\n",
    "JOIN dim_product p ON f.product_id = p.product_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**🛠️ Lakeflow Pipeline:**\n",
    "- Review SQL files in `/Lakeflow/` for production-ready streaming implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Whatngratulations!** 🎉 \n",
    "You have completed the Medallion Architecture implementation following the Lakeflow model!\n",
